## MkDocs

MkDocs is a useful documentation tool that processes Markdown files into a static website. The source Markdown files for the website are simple text files and images that can easily be maintained under version control. For example, text file versions are tracked rather than binary document files such as Microsoft Word. This approach works well for many documents that benefit from navigation and web integration.

MkDocs software is free and open source and only requires that Python is installed while editing the documentation (Python is not needed to view the website when deployed to the cloud). 

###  Using MkDocs for the following purposes:

- Software developer documentation - explain how to set up and use the development environment
- Software user documentation - provide navigable documentation with screen shots and examples
- Project documentation - use navigable website rather than PDF documents so that project content can more easily be a living document
- Process documentation - use navigable website to facilitate understanding process steps at summary and detailed level
